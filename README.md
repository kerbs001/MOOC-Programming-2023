# MOOC Programming 2024

## Description
The Python Programming MOOC 2024, offered by the University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science, is a comprehensive course divided into two parts: Introduction to Programming (BSCS1001) and Advanced Course in Programming (BSCS1002). This course covers a range of programming exercises and exams to help students build a solid foundation in Python programming. All are the code solutions I made all throughout the course.
